## Easy21
This is the Easy21 assignment for David Silver's reinforcement learning course. <br />
Different RL algorithms (MC control, Sarsa lambda, Sarsa lambda w/ value approximation) play blackjack with negative-value cards. <br />
Written in Python.

## Equation Solver
A program that, given input variables and an output variable, and a set of equations, solves for the output variable in terms of the input variables, as long as it is possible. <br />
Optimal efficiency with dynamic programming. Treats the variables as nodes and the equations as describing groups of edges, and builds/traverses the graph greedily in depth-first order. <br />
Equations can contain the four elementary arithmetic operators, plus exponents.
Written in Python.

## Coursera_ML
Assignments from weeks 1-8 of Andrew Ng's 2011 Coursera ML [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
Moved on to study deep learning and reinforcement learning. <br />
Written in Octave.
